- Topic: APR I : From RTL to GDSII  
- TA: 駱育樺  

## Notice

&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the point of this lab is APR (Automatic Placement and Routing), we start our work from the gate-level design step, the sythesised design ```MMSA_SYN.v``` and ```MMSA_SYN.sdf``` were provided but not here. 
Also, the memory modules ```RA1SH.v``` and ```RA2SH.v``` used as SRAM were generated by the EDA tool from Artisan Components Inc., they are not provided here too due to copyright.
