# Final project - Customized ISA Processor

- Topic: Whole IC design workflow  
- TA: 黃熙皓  

## Acknowledgement

I have to appreciate [Ding (mirkat1206)](https://github.com/mirkat1206) for  ```PATTERN.v``` and ```FinalProj_DRAM_generate.py``` in ```./Br35_fp_pat1``` and ```./Br35_fp_pat2```, 
the above codes are adapted from her great works: https://github.com/mirkat1206/2021_Spring_NCTU_ICLAB/tree/main/Final_Project  

## Overview

We went through a whole IC design workflow completely in this final project:  
1. RTL design: ```./CPU.v```  
2. Sythesis: *RTL to Gate-level with* ```./syn.tcl```  
3. Gate-level simulation: ```./CPU_SYN.v```  
4. Memory: ```./mm2048_16.v```  
5. APR: *Pin_APR for* ```./CHIP_SYN.v```  
6. Post simulation: ```./CHIP.v```  

## Notice

- The memory module mm2048_16 used here was generated by the EDA tool from Artisan Components, Inc., it is non-pipeline and has words length: 2048, word width: 16.  
- The patterns in ```./Br35_fp_pat1``` and ```./Br35_fp_pat2``` check no reset fails (IO_stall should be high after a reset signal occurs), please be aware of it if you decide to use them.  
- There are 2 versions of my patterns, ```./Br35_fp_pat1``` and ```./Br35_fp_pat2```, the 1st one has very low probability of jumping back, while the 2nd one allows a dead loop.  
- Apparently, the problem of the 2nd one is the high probability of hanging into a dead loop, so we need a pattern number ```patnum``` here to give it a endpoint.
